# About

Xtruder was one of the more popular virus killers of the early to mid-nineties
for the Amiga computer created by me with help from Bj√∏rn Reese who wrote the
filevirus library.

This code is here for posteritys sake.

# Setup

It's not possible to compile as it's missing the filevirus library.
